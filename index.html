    <h1>Dylan Rosenlind</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Hello! I'm Dylan Rosenlind, a University of Washington graduate and software engineer at <a href="https://www.armada.ai/">Armada</a>        
            in Bellevue, WA. At UW, I was a pure mathematics major with academic interests in 
            computer vision, optimization, high-performance computing, and numerical analysis. I started at UW in the fall of 
            2021 with little idea of what I wanted to pursue academically or professionally, but that changed within months. 
            In the math and computer science courses I took during my freshman year, I found that collaborating with similarly
            passionate students makes my drive and enthusiasm grow exponentially. I hope to spend my career working 
            on various complex problems in the domains of distributed systems,
            high-performance computing, computer vision, and machine learning.
        </p>
