    <h1>Dylan Rosenlind</h1>

    <p>
        Hello! I'm Dylan Rosenlind, an undergraduate pure mathematics student at the University of Washington.
        My academic interests include combinatorics, algorithms, algebraic geometry, optimization, and high-performance
        computing. I started at UW in the fall of 2021 with little idea of what I wanted to pursue 
        academically or professionally, but that changed within months. In the math and computer 
        science courses I took during my freshman year, I found that collaborating with similarly
        passionate students makes my drive and enthusiasm grow exponentially. Though I'm still working out exact 
        details, I plan to pursue a career in software engineering or some related field. I'm happy to say I will be working
        as a Probe Software Engineering Intern at Micron this Summer!
    </p>
