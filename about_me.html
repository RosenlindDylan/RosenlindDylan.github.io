    <h2>What I'm up to</h2>

    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>
        I'm currently doing research at UW Electrical and Computer Engineering NOISE Photonics Lab. I'm doing software
        for them and also getting to learn a lot about the resarch process. I implemented a 
        <a href="https://github.com/RosenlindDylan/Krylov-Algorithms">Conjugate Gradient Krylov iterative algorithm</a> 
        based off a paper we're looking at. This was a fun intersection of my fields of study, math and computer science.
        Linear algebra is my favorite field of math (so far) which made learning about Krylov subspaces in order to implement
        this very enjoyable.
    </p>

    <h3>Coursework</h3>

    <p>
        This summer I took Linear Optimization (Linear Programming) which is the first part in the math department's optimization series. While
        this class was interesting, I'm very much looking forward to the final part of the series which is discrete optimization.
        Network flows and problems have been a favorite of mine in previous math and computer science classes so I look forward to 
        seeing more of it in the future. These courses that involve an intersection of math and cs have intellectually and personally
        engaged me more than any other courses so I hope to find a software engineering position that engages me similarly.
