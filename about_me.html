    <h2>What I'm up to</h2>

    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>
        I'm currently doing research at UW Electrical and Computer Engineering NOISE Photonics Lab. I'm doing software
        for them and also getting to learn a lot about the resarch process. I implemented a 
        <a href="https://github.com/RosenlindDylan/Krylov-Algorithms">Conjugate Gradient Krylov iterative algorithm</a> 
        based off a paper we're looking at. This was a fun intersection of my fields of study, math and computer science.
        Linear algebra is my favorite field of math (so far) which made learning about Krylov subspaces in order to implement
        this very enjoyable.
    </p>

    <h3>Coursework</h3>

    <p>
        This summer, I took Linear Optimization (Linear Programming), which is the first part of 
        the math department's optimization series. While this class was interesting, I'm eagerly
         looking forward to the final part of the series, which is discrete optimization. Network
          flows and problems have been favorites of mine in previous math and computer science 
          classes. Courses that combine mathematics and computer science have consistently 
          captured my intellectual and personal interest more than any other courses. I hope to 
          someday secure a software engineering position that provides a similar feeling of
           engagement and fulfillment.
    </p>

    <h3>Work</h3>

    <p>
        I had the unique opportunity to join the Seattle Celtic Soccer Club as a youth soccer coach 
        this summer. Despite having played soccer my whole life, this was the first time I found 
        myself on this side of soccer development. Coaching brought forth its own novel
         challenges for me to tackle, and I believe I've experienced significant personal growth 
         through this part-time position. For instance, after guiding groups of sometimes unruly 
         (albeit hilarous) 5 to 14-year-olds through soccer drills, difficulties that might arise 
         from working with challenging colleagues can't fluster me!
