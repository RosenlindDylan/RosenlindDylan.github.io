    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! My name is Dylan Rosenlind, I am a Junior at the wonderful University of Washington 
        studying math with an emphasis on probability, applied linear algebra, and combinatorics!
        I started at UW in the fall of 2021 with little to no idea of what I wanted to pursue 
        academically or professionally, but that changed within months. In the math and computer 
        science courses I took during my freshman year, I found that collaborating with similarly
        passionate students makes my drive and enthusiasm grow exponentially. I'm now seeking this
        same environment at a software engineering internship for Summer of 2024!
    </p>
